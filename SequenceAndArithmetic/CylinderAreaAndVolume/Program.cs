//Plan
//DECLARE inputValue as string
//DELCARE radius as double
//DELCARE length as double
//DECLARE pi as double
//DECLARE area as double
//DECLARE volume as double

//Prompt for radius
//Read input
//SET radius to input
//Prompt for length
//Read input
//SET length to input
//SET pi to the Math constant of pi

//Calculate and set area to radius * radius * pi
//Calculate and set volume to area * length

//DISPLAY area in a statement
//DISPLAY volume in a statement
